"""pickle compat"""

# [MODULE DOC]
# Pickle (de)serialization of arbitrary objects, with pandas-aware handling of
# compression, URLs and storage options. Public contents: to_pickle and
# read_pickle, both exported as top-level pandas functions (and used by the
# DataFrame/Series pickle methods). Relationships: uses the shared io common
# handle opener for compression and remote paths, and falls back to the
# pandas compat unpickler for objects written by older pandas versions.
# No import-time side effects beyond imports.

    Pickle (serialize) object to file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : any object
        Any python object.
    filepath_or_buffer : str, path object, or file-like object
        String, path object (implementing ``os.PathLike[str]``), or file-like
        object implementing a binary ``write()`` function.
        Also accepts URL. URL has to be of S3 or GCS.
    compression : str or dict, default 'infer'
        For on-the-fly compression of the output data. If 'infer' and
        'filepath_or_buffer' is path-like, then detect compression from the
        following extensions: '.gz', '.bz2', '.zip', '.xz', '.zst', '.tar',
        '.tar.gz', '.tar.xz' or '.tar.bz2' (otherwise no compression).
        Set to ``None`` for no compression.
        Can also be a dict with key ``'method'`` set
        to one of {``'zip'``, ``'gzip'``, ``'bz2'``, ``'zstd'``, ``'xz'``,
        ``'tar'``} and other key-value pairs are forwarded to
        ``zipfile.ZipFile``, ``gzip.GzipFile``,
        ``bz2.BZ2File``, ``zstandard.ZstdCompressor``, ``lzma.LZMAFile`` or
        ``tarfile.TarFile``, respectively.
        As an example, the following could be passed for faster compression
        and to create a reproducible gzip archive:
        ``compression={'method': 'gzip', 'compresslevel': 1, 'mtime': 1}``.
    protocol : int
        Int which indicates which protocol should be used by the pickler,
        default HIGHEST_PROTOCOL (see [1], paragraph 12.1.2). The possible
        values for this parameter depend on the version of Python. For Python
        2.x, possible values are 0, 1, 2. For Python>=3.0, 3 is a valid value.
        For Python >= 3.4, 4 is a valid value. A negative value for the
        protocol parameter is equivalent to setting its value to
        HIGHEST_PROTOCOL.
    storage_options : dict, optional
        Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g.
        host, port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs
        are forwarded to ``urllib.request.Request`` as header options. For other
        URLs (e.g. starting with "s3://", and "gcs://") the key-value pairs are
        forwarded to ``fsspec.open``. Please see ``fsspec`` and ``urllib`` for more
        details, and for more examples on storage options refer `here
        <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html?

    Load pickled pandas object (or any object) from file and return unpickled object.

    .. warning::

       Loading pickled data received from untrusted sources can be
       unsafe. See `here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath_or_buffer : str, path object, or file-like object
        String, path object (implementing ``os.PathLike[str]``), or file-like
        object implementing a binary ``readlines()`` function.
        Also accepts URL. URL is not limited to S3 and GCS.
    compression : str or dict, default 'infer'
        For on-the-fly decompression of on-disk data. If 'infer' and
        'filepath_or_buffer' is path-like, then detect compression from the
        following extensions: '.gz', '.bz2', '.zip', '.xz', '.zst', '.tar',
        '.tar.gz', '.tar.xz' or '.tar.bz2' (otherwise no compression).
        If using 'zip' or 'tar', the ZIP file must contain only one data file
        to be read in.
        Set to ``None`` for no decompression.
        Can also be a dict with key ``'method'`` set
        to one of {``'zip'``, ``'gzip'``, ``'bz2'``, ``'zstd'``, ``'xz'``,
        ``'tar'``} and other key-value pairs are forwarded to
        ``zipfile.ZipFile``, ``gzip.GzipFile``,
        ``bz2.BZ2File``, ``zstandard.ZstdDecompressor``, ``lzma.LZMAFile`` or
        ``tarfile.TarFile``, respectively.
        As an example, the following could be passed for Zstandard decompression
        using a custom compression dictionary:
        ``compression={'method': 'zstd', 'dict_data': my_compression_dict}``.
    storage_options : dict, optional
        Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g.
        host, port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs
        are forwarded to ``urllib.request.Request`` as header options. For other
        URLs (e.g. starting with "s3://", and "gcs://") the key-value pairs are
        forwarded to ``fsspec.open``. Please see ``fsspec`` and ``urllib`` for more

    Returns
    -------
    object
        The unpickled pandas object (or any object) that was stored in file.

    See Also
    --------
    DataFrame.to_pickle : Pickle (serialize) DataFrame object to file.
    Series.to_pickle : Pickle (serialize) Series object to file.
    read_hdf : Read HDF5 file into a DataFrame.
    read_sql : Read SQL query or database table into a DataFrame.
    read_parquet : Load a parquet object, returning a DataFrame.

    Notes
    -----
    read_pickle is only guaranteed to be backwards compatible to pandas 1.0
    provided the object was serialized with to_pickle.

    --------
    >>> original_df = pd.DataFrame(
    ...     {"foo": range(5), "bar": range(5, 10)}
